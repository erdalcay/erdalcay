### Hi! :raised_hands:

This is Erdal. 

I am a marketing & analytics engineer who loves to build tools, automate stuff and crunch some data. 

I use mostly **Node.js** in my daily development routine and **R** & **Python** & **SQL** when it is for notebook development, data visualization and quantitative analysis.
